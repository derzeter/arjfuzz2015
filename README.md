What's a fuzzer ?
=================

Fuzzing or fuzz testing is an automated software testing technique that involves providing invalid, unexpected, or random data 
as inputs to a computer program. The program is then monitored for exceptions such as crashes, failing built-in code assertions, or potential memory leaks.

This one is for the web (against websites) - to find hidden stuff ! 
To use and play nicely.
